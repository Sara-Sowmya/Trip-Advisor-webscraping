Trip Advisory System
Project Overview
The Trip Advisory system is a recommendation model that helps users choose the best hotels based on their preferences. It leverages data like hotel ratings, location, price, and other factors to provide personalized recommendations. This system uses machine learning techniques to predict the most suitable hotels for users based on their search criteria.

Features
Hotel Rating: Predicts the best hotels based on user ratings.

Price Filtering: Allows users to filter hotels within their budget.

Location: Suggests hotels in preferred locations.

Personalized Recommendations: Based on user preferences and past reviews.

How It Works
The system provides recommendations using the following steps:

Data Loading: The dataset contains information about hotels, including ratings, location, price, and other features.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values and normalizing data.

Model Training: A machine learning model is used to predict which hotels are best suited for a given user based on input features.

Prediction: Users can input their preferences (location, price, rating) and the system returns a list of hotels.

Data
The project uses hotel-related data, including:

Hotel Name

Price

Rating

Location

Amenities

Hotel Type (e.g., luxury, budget)

Sample Data (from ParisHotel.csv):
The dataset contains information about hotels in Paris, which includes features such as hotel name, price, rating, and location.

Installation and Setup
Dependencies:
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn
Install Required Libraries:
Use the following command to install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Code:
To run the project:

Load the Jupyter notebook (Trip Advisory.ipynb).

Run each cell to train the model and make predictions.

The final result will show hotel recommendations based on user input.

Model Details
Model Used:
A classification or recommendation model such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Collaborative Filtering is used to predict the hotel that best matches the user's input.

Metrics:
The model's performance can be evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: To check how well the model predicts the correct hotel choices.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): To evaluate the quality of hotel price predictions.

User Interface
A simple interface is provided to the user where they can:

Input preferences: Users can select their preferred hotel features like price, location, and rating.

Receive recommendations: Based on their input, the system will return a list of hotels.

Example of UI interaction:

python
Copy
gr.Interface(fn=trip_advisory_model, 
             inputs=["text", "number", "dropdown"], 
             outputs="list").launch()
Next Steps
Future Improvements:
Advanced Model: Implement collaborative filtering or content-based filtering for better recommendations.

User Feedback: Allow users to provide feedback on recommendations to improve the model further.

Geospatial Analysis: Integrate location-based services for better hotel recommendations by distance.

Conclusion
This Trip Advisory System is a great tool for helping travelers make informed decisions about where to stay, based on personal preferences and predictive analytics.
